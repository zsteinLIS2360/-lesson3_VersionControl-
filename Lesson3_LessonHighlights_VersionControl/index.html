            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control (VCS) is a system that saves any changes you may make to a file so you can go back to a previous version of your work later on. A Version Control System is useful because you can save all versions of a file in one place that can be accessed by all members of a team. If you start going down one path in a project and find you don’t like it, you can always revert back to a previous saved version. This saves a lot of time and stress compared to having to go back through the document and edit it back manually.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of version control system that saves data in the form of snapshots. Most other VCS systems save information based on file changes. You can think of Git as a directory of snapshots. Git is very efficient in the sense that if no change was made to the file, it will not save the file again, rather just link it to the file already in its storage. Git only needs local files to work. It requires no foreign computer or network. This provides the user ease of saving and gives almost instant file history. This also means that you can work offline, anywhere you please.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first version of what is now Git began in what was called the Linux kernel. It was a software project that started in 1999. The project began using a version control system called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005 the company that created and owned BitKeeper no longer offered its services for free. This prompted Linux to create its own VCS tool. Linux kernel kept many aspects of BitKeeper incuding speed, design, distribution, and efficiency. In 2005, Git was officially born. Git is now open source software that is not only fast, but highly effective with projects of all sizes. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is where files and directories can be stored. This is where all saved versions of a file can be accessed from. There are two type of repositories; Remote Repositories and Local Repositories. A remote repository is located on a remote server and can be shared amongst many people. A local repository is located on an individual’s machine, and that machine only. There are two ways to make a local repository. You can create a new one, or you can even clone one that already exists within the system.  Both the local and remote repositories are compatible with git and can be very easy and valuable to use. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">How to use Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first step in using Git is to initialize the repository and add an origin. As you create the files you want to store with Git, send them to the staging area to be stored. This can be done with the command “git add .”Once you are ready to move the files from the staging area to the repository, type in the command “git commit –m “…” Once you have committed the files the next step is to use the command “git push” to move the files from the local repository into the remote repository. Alternatively, if you want to move a file from a remote repository into a local repository, use the command “git pull”  The three steps again are add, commit, push.</p>
